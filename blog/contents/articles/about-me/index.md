I'm Koen Metsu, an all-round developer with a passion for web and mobile development, general coding best practices and ALM. 

#DuckDuckGo

In my spare time I'm working on the official [DuckDuckGo Search](http://duckduckgo.com/about) app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5kdWNrZHVja2dvLm1vYmlsZS5hbmRyb2lkIl0.) and [Windows 8](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/duckduckgo/d526ba1b-a065-4cb9-a6c6-bf30f6123e2b), both of which you should try out for yourself right now if you care about [better search](http://dontbubble.us/) and [more privacy](http://donttrack.us/) on the web. 

#NuGetFight

I'm also co-creator of [www.nugetfight.com](http://www.nugetfight.com), a fun site where you can let NuGet packages fight to the death!( need I say more? Go make them fight! )

#Life

My spare spare time is dedicated to learning new things and trying out new stuff in the developer world. When I'm not writing code I play the guitar, am a geek about movies and love spending time with my family.
