##About me
Hi, I'm Koen Metsu, a freelance .NET consultant who's driven to make the complex simple. My main focus area lies in Web & Mobile for .NET and helping teams build better software. 

I have experience as coach and trainer, giving .NET courses and helping others identify patterns and best practices.

- Git


##Work experience
###Debreuck & Neirynck - Senior Software Engineer ( May 2012 - Present )
At Debreuck & Neirynck I'm working on many different domains, building custom software that integrates with the customer's existing solutions. While my main focus still lies on .NET, I've also learned Ruby On Rails and Java while working on these projects. 

I've also taken the lead on our mobile projects for both Android & Windows Phone 8. 

###DuckDuckGo - Mobile Developer ( Sep 2012 - Present )
I started my remote freelance work for DuckDuckGo to build their Windows 8 app. I've worked on this with another remote partner and was able to deliver fast and successfully. I joined their Android app team afterwards where I'm still involved in both new development as well as maintenance. 

I've also made some contributions on Orbot, an OSS library that provides anonymity on the internet through integration with the TOR network. 

###RealDolmen - Software Engineer ( Oct 2007 - Apr 2012 )
As a .NET consultant I have worked on a wide range of web projects for various RealDolmen customers, either in team, independently or as lead. 

I have coached new developers on patterns and practices and have given both internal and external trainings on topics such as TDD, Code Contracts and deep-dive courses on C# .NET. 

I was also an active member in a number of small R&D groups within RealDolmen.
